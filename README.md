# Facility Management System - webSCADA

Application is a webSCADA system written in Python and JavaScript. Backend is made in Flask micro-framework and frontend is based on JavaScript (JQuery) and Bootstrap v5.

To connect to devices supporting OPC UA standard asynchronous tasks were used. Connection is based on python-opcua module.

Admin user can manage devices and users (add, delete), normal non-admin user is only permitted to view visualized data from connected devices.

Application uses two databases - one relational (SQLite) and one non-relational (MongoDB). First one is used to save user and devices data, second one is used as a container for acquised data from devices.

Dashboard shows data in real-time, refreshing interval is set to 0.3s.

This project is a result of engineering work at the Rzesz√≥w University of Technology.
